# Module 5 Companion - Master Network Programmability

## Software Defined Networking Course

> **Ready to unlock the power of modern network automation?** You've conquered CLI scripting with Netmiko and mastered APIs with Requests. Now it's time to explore the cutting-edge world of **RESTCONF, NETCONF, and YANG** - the technologies that make enterprise network automation truly scalable!

## 🎯 What You'll Practice

Transform from CLI scripter to network automation architect by hands-on practice with:

- **YANG Data Models** - Discover the "blueprints" of network configuration
- **RESTCONF** - Build on your Requests skills for standardized network APIs  
- **NETCONF** - Explore XML-based network management protocols
- **Real-world Integration** - Connect all the pieces for enterprise-grade automation

**Challenge Level**: 🔥🔥🔥 **Advanced** (We're preparing you to ace those assessments!)

## 🗂 Learning Path

Each section builds your expertise progressively. **You've got this!**

### [Section 01: Network Device Explorer](./01_exploration/)

**Mission**: Get familiar with YANG models and network device capabilities  
**Skills**: Use `help()`, `dir()`, explore device schemas  
**Challenge**: Discover what's possible before diving deep!

### [Section 02: RESTCONF Foundations](./02_restconf_foundations/)  

**Mission**: Build on your Requests library skills for network automation  
**Skills**: Authentication, basic GET operations, JSON parsing  
**Why Start Here**: You already know Requests - let's level it up!

### [Section 03: YANG Models - The Network "Blueprint"](./03_yang_models/) 

**Mission**: Master the "blueprints" that make everything else possible  
**Skills**: Navigate YANG trees, understand data structures, find what you need  
**Game Changer**: This unlocks both RESTCONF and NETCONF mastery!

### [Section 04: RESTCONF Configuration Management](./04_advanced_restconf/) 

**Mission**: Configuration changes and complex data retrieval  
**Skills**: POST/PUT/DELETE operations, error handling, bulk operations  
**Real World**: Enterprise-grade network automation starts here!

### [Section 05: NETCONF Fundamentals](./05_netconf_fundamentals/) 

**Mission**: Explore XML-based network management protocols  
**Skills**: ncclient library, XML parsing, NETCONF capabilities  
**New Territory**: Different from REST, but incredibly powerful!

### [Section 06: Advanced NETCONF & XML Processing](./06_advanced_netconf/) 

**Mission**: Complex configurations and sophisticated data extraction  
**Skills**: XPath queries, configuration transactions, advanced XML manipulation  
**Expert Level**: Handle enterprise network complexity with confidence!

### [Section 07: Integration & Automation](./07_integration/) 

**Mission**: Combine RESTCONF and NETCONF for complete solutions  
**Skills**: Multi-protocol workflows, error recovery, production-ready scripts  
**Victory Lap**: You're now a network programmability architect!

## 🚀 Getting Hands-On

Each directory contains your mission briefing and starter code. **No copy-paste solutions here** - you'll build real skills by implementing the TODO items yourself!

**Pro Tip**: Start with Section 01 to explore and get oriented, then dive into RESTCONF since you already rock the Requests library!

## 🎯 Practice Callouts

> **"We don't give you the fish - we teach you to fish!"** Every module contains starter code with TODO items that YOU need to implement. This isn't about copying solutions; it's about building the skills you'll need for assessments and your career.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Install requirements**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Start exploring**: Begin with `01_exploration/`
3. **Follow your curiosity**: Each README guides your next steps
4. **Code to learn**: Complete the TODO items to make everything work

## 🛠️ Your Toolkit

**Languages & Libraries You'll Use:**

- **Python** (your foundation!)
- **requests** (level up from Module 4!)
- **ncclient** (new XML-based networking magic)
- **lxml** (XML parsing powerhouse)

**What You Already Know:**

- ✅ Python fundamentals, objects, error handling
- ✅ Netmiko for CLI automation  
- ✅ REST API concepts with Postman/cURL
- ✅ Requests library for API interactions

**What You'll Add:**

- 🆕 YANG data model navigation
- 🆕 RESTCONF standardized network APIs
- 🆕 NETCONF XML-based protocols
- 🆕 Enterprise network automation patterns

## 🏆 Success Criteria

By the end, you'll confidently explain and demonstrate:

- How YANG models define network device capabilities
- When to choose RESTCONF vs NETCONF for different tasks  
- Building Python scripts that configure network devices safely
- Parsing and processing both JSON and XML network data
- Integrating multiple protocols for comprehensive automation solutions
