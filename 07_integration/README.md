# 07: Integration & Automation

## 🎯 Mission

Bring it all together! Combine RESTCONF, NETCONF, and YANG knowledge to build complete network automation solutions. Create production-ready scripts that leverage the best of both protocols for comprehensive network management.

## 🎖 Goals  

- [ ] Build integrated workflows using both RESTCONF and NETCONF  
- [ ] Create intelligent protocol selection based on task requirements
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery strategies
- [ ] Design scalable automation frameworks for enterprise networks
- [ ] Build complete network automation use cases from start to finish

## 💡 Hints

**Best of Both Worlds**: Use RESTCONF for simple operations and monitoring, NETCONF for complex configurations and transactions.

**Protocol Selection**: Choose protocols based on requirements:

- RESTCONF: Simple queries, web integration, stateless operations
- NETCONF: Complex changes, transactions, enterprise robustness

**Error Recovery**: Plan for network failures, authentication issues, and partial configuration failures.

**Scalability**: Design for multiple devices, concurrent operations, and large-scale deployments.

**Real-World Ready**: Include logging, monitoring, and operational best practices.
